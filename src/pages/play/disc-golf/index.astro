        Disc Golf

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        This sport was invisible to me for many years. I knew that disc golf
        courses existed, but before I was introduced to disc golf when I was
        working at MasterControl I had no idea the quality and quantity of disc
        golf courses within driving distance.

        The first course I ever played was Creekside in Holliday. I was
        immediately hooked.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
        That day, I looked up local courses and found a lot to pick from, so I
        chose Art Dye in American Fork to visit first. I drove my long commute
        from Cottonwood Heights back down to Utah County, stopped by Art Dye
        Park and went to find the disc golf course. Like magic, there it was. A
        huge course with 18 holes with chain catchers and everything.

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        I was so excited about it, I called up my parents and told them I found
        them a new sport.
